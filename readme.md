## ðŸ”§ What This Project Does

This shell script automates the installation of the Cursor AI code editor on Ubuntu. Here's what it does step by step:

1. **Fetch the Latest Version**  
   Retrieves the latest Cursor AI version and download URL from a public JSON file.

2. **Download Files**  
   Downloads the Cursor AppImage and icon into a temporary directory.

3. **Install to System Directory**  
   Moves the AppImage and icon to `/opt/cursor-ai` for centralized access.

4. **Set Permissions**  
   Applies the appropriate permissions to ensure the app runs smoothly and securely.

5. **Create Desktop Shortcut**  
   Generates a `.desktop` launcher file so Cursor AI appears in your app menu like a native app.
